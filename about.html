                        I am a 21 year old Games Development student studying Programming at Falmouth University, working towards a bachelors of arts. I have been interested in the games industry for a long time but only began working with games and their engines in 2018. Though I have only been interacting with the behind-the-scenes of games for a short time, I have worked with a multitude of programming languages, systems and specialties. Below is some information about some of my areas of knowledge and experience, going into some details on each topic to help display more.

                    <h3>Unity Game Engine</h3>
                    <h6>Multiple Unity Versions</h6>
                    <p>
                        From the start of my game development journey in 2018, Unity was the first game engine in which I worked in. Due to this being the first engine I used, I have worked in many different versions from Unity 4.0 up to Unity 6.0 as well as trying new versions as they release. Through the years of which I have been using Unity, I have come to grasp the engine very well with all tools and functions feeling very natural and familiar.

                    <h3>Unreal Game Engine Blueprints</h3>
                    <h6>Unreal Engine 5</h6>
                    <p>
                        I first used Unreal Game Engine while in my second year at university in which I learnt my way around the engine and blueprints. I have only used Unreal Engine for one project so far in which I created a racing car enemy AI which was able to follow pathing lines, react to other players or AI and would even make slight mistakes when making maneuvers. I plan to use Unreal more in future for projects along with learning more C++ to utilise in the Engine.

                    <h3>Unity C#</h3>
                    <h6>Multiple Unity Versions</h6>
                    <p>
                        Before using Unity, I had briefly used C# on it's own to create simple games like minesweeper, roulette and battleships (as most computing students do while in school or college). I later then began to use this knowledge within Unity to begin to add functionality and usibility to my games. Over this time, I have learnt skills including but not limited to; object orientated programming, version control using GitHub and even adaptability to update and version constrictions and changes.

                    <h3>HTML and Java Script</h3>
                    <p>
                        Previously through school and college, I had learnt simple HTML code but had never taken it further. Recently, I decided it was time to develop these skills and create my own website to showcase my work and projects (the website that you're viewing this on). While learning HTML, I also learnt pieces of CSS and Java Script to get my website to run correctly and to look how I want it to.

                    <h3>Disability Awareness and Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                        This may not appear to many people as something which is helpful in the games industry but knowledge on different disabilities and human restrictions is a vital part when it comes to creating anything for people. This knowledge is utilised heavily when testing the usibility for anything in which people will need to interact with and is often where systems in and out of the games industry fail and restrict the people which are included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have worked with many disabilities through my life, being a young carer for most of my childhood, starting with things like Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and later assisting with more phycological based functionality like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After working with so many diverse disabilities and illnesses (many of which have not been named due to volume), I have found that a lot of things in life are only suitable to people who are able-bodied or as some would say "the normality". Because of this, A major goal through my game development is accessibility for as many people as possible. Through extended research on sight impairments, hearing impairments and learning difficulties, I often remake or correct systems and projects I have made to help make thing as accessible to everybody as I can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a final note on this topic, I would like to thank my mum for starting me on this journey of knowledge and, even though she sometimes may not think she has helped due to her conditions, I would be nowhere near where I am now without her, able-bodied or not. If you have a disability of any sort, you should never feel that it is a reason for you to be different or seperate from others, it doesn't make who you are, you do.
